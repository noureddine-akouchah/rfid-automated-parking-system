# RFID Automated Parking System (Demo)

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates an automated parking access control system based on RFID technology.
It is inspired by a BTS final year project and designed for educational and demonstration purposes.

## ⚙️ Features
- RFID-based access control
- Arduino Uno as central controller
- Motorized barrier logic (simulation/industrial-ready)
- Modbus RS485 communication (VFD compatible)
- Real-time entry/exit logging in Excel
- Clear system architecture and wiring

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Arduino Uno
- RFID RC522
- RS485 / Modbus
- Excel (PLX-DAQ)
- Industrial motor control logic
- Fritzing (wiring diagrams)
